### Conflict Plan

**What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?**

We will try to resolve the conflict as a group and if that doesn’t work, we will loop in the instructor.

**What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?**

We will attempt to discuss it as a group and try to mitigate via assigning certain tasks to people. We will also prioritize ongoing communication as a group.

**How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?**

We will prioritize being and ensuring a safe space to ask questions.

**How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?**

We will assign tasks and articulate what needs to be done and be in constant communication checking in with each other.

If our resolution attempts are unsuccessful, we will contact our instructor and we will escalate as soon as possible.

**How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?**

Slack and/or email.

**What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?**

We will ask everyone at the end of a session in case they have anything to add. We will use the chat if others are talking.
