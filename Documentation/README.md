## Web Application

[Requirements and Vision Statement](/Documentation/requirements.md)

Welcome to our streamlined news-gathering experience! Here a user can more efficiently stay informed on diverse topics 
with a more balanced picture as we utilize data from multiple news sources.  Our console application cuts down on time 
for users to access and read top headlines, then can further provide sorted headlines by categories of news. The output 
received is the headline and link of an article. The user has the option to see the summary of that article then decide 
weather they would like to click the link to read the full piece, return to the prior headline options or quit the 
application. We hope you enjoy our approach to news-gathering.
